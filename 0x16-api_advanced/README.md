This repository demonstrates essential skills for working with APIs and manipulating data in Python. Learning how to effectively navigate API documentation to locate relevant endpoints, handle paginated responses for large datasets, and parse JSON results into usable Python objects. We also cover the implementation of recursive API calls for traversing hierarchical data structures or handling rate limits. Additionally, you'll find examples of how to sort dictionaries by their values, a common task when processing API responses. Each concept is illustrated with clear, concise code examples and explanations, providing a solid foundation for building robust applications that interact with web APIs and process the returned data efficiently.
